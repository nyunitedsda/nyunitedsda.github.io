# NY United SDA Website Performance Guide

## Performance Optimizations Implemented

### 1. Code Splitting and Lazy Loading
- All route components use React.lazy for on-demand loading
- Added Suspense with loading fallbacks to improve user experience during component loading
- Implemented smart component grouping in route definitions

### 2. Image Optimizations
- Enhanced Image component to use WebP format when available
- Added responsive image loading with srcset and sizes attributes
- Implemented lazy loading for all images to defer off-screen image loading
- Added aspectRatio to prevent layout shifts during image loading

### 3. State Management and API Optimizations
- Implemented proper React Query caching strategies with:
  - Appropriate staleTime and gcTime settings
  - Placeholder data during loading
  - Retry policies with exponential backoff
  - Optimized refetching policies

### 4. Bundle Optimization
- Implemented chunk splitting by library category
  - React core
  - Material UI components
  - TanStack libraries
  - Other vendor code
- Added content hashing for better cache control
- Added bundle analyzer script (`npm run build:analyze`)

### 5. Component Rendering Optimizations
- Added memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Optimized Carousel component for better performance
- Improved rendering efficiency in list components

## Performance Monitoring

### Build Analysis
Run the performance analysis tool:
```bash
npm run build:analyze
```
This will generate a visualization of your bundle in `./stats.html` that opens automatically after the build.

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- First Contentful Paint (FCP): < 1.8s
- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): < 2.5s
- First Input Delay (FID): < 100ms
- Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): < 0.1
- Time to Interactive (TTI): < 3.8s

## Future Improvement Opportunities

### Additional Optimizations to Consider:
- Implement server-side rendering or static site generation for critical pages
- Add service worker for offline support
- Implement resource hints (preconnect, preload) for critical third-party resources
- Consider using Intersection Observer API for more efficient scroll-based loading
- Implement font loading optimizations (font-display: swap)

### Performance Testing Tools
- Lighthouse (built into Chrome DevTools)
- WebPageTest.org
- Google PageSpeed Insights
- Chrome User Experience Report
